            <p>
                The present world has seen tremendous changes in the way it operates. It is still tending to advance, and the most important factor it chooses is technology. Technology has been existing for a long time. In modern society, technology has affected the life of almost each individual. It has improved peopleâ€™s lifestyle in many ways. Now, people seem to find technology as a basic necessity instead of just a convenience.

                Technology has affected how people receive information. The media broadcasts the news frequently, so people do not have to wait for the morning newspaper anymore. There are plenty of media channels and websites which update the news around the world, and with just a few clicks people can know the events happening around the globe almost every hour. Besides the news, people might also need to retrieve information for learning purposes or for gaining knowledge on a certain topic. They can do so via the internet.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, a lot of daily activities of individuals have been changed with the advancement of technology. For example, people are using a lot of electric appliances in the kitchen such as refrigerators, microwave ovens, electric kettles and so on. People can also use their phones to keep a reminder of any upcoming events or set alarms.. People can now talk over the phone at any time they want as almost every other individual owns a cellphone, and sometimes even see each other through video calls. Technology has also affected the means of entertainment. Now, people can watch movies in the comfort of their home. They can even play video games, listen to music, and even read virtual books.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is known that technology has advanced a lot. This can be proved with the example of the current situation of the world. The world is facing a pandemic- COVID-19. The educational institutions, commercial industries and businesses have been closed, however, it has not stopped them from operating. Only a few months after the institutions shut down, they began to run online classes. Platforms such as Zoom, Google Meet, Google Classroom, MySecondTeacher, Veda Guru helped the teachers and the students to experience the teaching and learning process as if they were in their own classroom. Similarly, a lot of online businesses arose as well; people can place their orders from their own room, and the products will be delivered right to their doorstep.

                Although technology has made life easier for people, there are some downsides to it. People have been spending a lot of time looking at screens. The light emitted from the screens can harm the eyes. Similarly, people are trying to search for convenience in every way possible. It has reduced their physical activities. In conclusion, technology has affected the lives of people in many ways. Along with the comfort, there are some negative outcomes as well. Hence, with the right use of technology, the world can develop more than it already has.
